                    In the first decade of the 20th century, Manchester United played their home 
                    matches at a 50,000 stadium at Bank Street,when then president Davies began 
                    planning for a new stadium with double that capacity. A site was chosen near 
                    Trafford Park industrial estate,and architect Archibald Leitch was appointed 
                    to design the stadium.Old Trafford officially opened on 19 February 1910 
                    with a match between Manchester and Liverpool (3-4).The stadium at that 
                    time consisted of one covered seating stand and open terraces on the other 
                    three sides. Capacity was slightly over 80,000.Few changes were made to the 
                    stadium until the construction of a roof over the United Road terrace in 
                    1934.In 1939,Old Trafford recorded its highest attendance of 76,962 during 
                    an FA Cup semi-final match between Wolves and Grimsby Town.

                    Barça's new stadium replaced their old ground of Les Corts which with a 
                    capacity of just 48,000 was too small to accomodate the interest 
                    generated by a team led by Hungarian star Ladislao Kubala.The stadium 
                    was designed by architects Francesc Mitjans Miró and Josep Soteras Mauri
                    with the collaboration of Lorenzo García Barbón,and it was constructed 
                    between 1955 and 1957,using mainly concrete and iron. The whole project 
                    cost a staggering 288 million pesetas, which meant the club would spend 
                    the following years heavily in debt.Although it was originally going to 
                    go under the official name of ‘Estadi del FC Barcelona’,it soon came to 
                    be popularly known as the 'Camp Nou'(the ‘new ground’), as opposed to 
                    the club’s old home at Les Corts. It was not until the 2000/2001 season 
                    that,following a postal vote made by the Club membership,that the 
                    decision was made to make ‘Camp Nou’ the official name of the stadium. 
                    Of the 29,102 votes the club received, a total of 19,861 (68.25%) 
                    preferred Camp Nou.

            Stamford Bridge officially opened on the 28th of April 1877, but for the next 28 years 
            mainly served as an athletics venue.The owners, however, wanted a stadium that could 
            host professional football, and hired architect Archibald Leitch to design a new 
            stadium.Stamford Bridge got almost completely rebuilt in 1905,and was subsequently 
            offered to Fulham FC. Fulham turned offer down though, and newly formed Chelsea FC 
            moved in instead.Stamford Bridge at that time consisted of one covered seating stand 
            and a vast open bowl of terraces covering the other three sides. An estimated 100,000 
            people could fit into the stadium.Few changes were made until 1930, when new terraces 
            were built at the Shed End, and, nine years later, when a small seating stand was 
            built at the North End.Stamford Bridge recorded its highest attendance in 1935 during 
            a match against Arsenal when a total of 82,905 fans attended the match.

                    The Santiago Bernabéu Stadium (Spanish: Estadio Santiago Bernabéu is a football 
                    stadium in Madrid, Spain.With a current seating capacity of 81,044,[5]it has 
                    been the home stadium of Real Madrid since its completion in 1947.[2] It is the 
                    second-largest stadium in Spain and third-largest home to a top-flight European 
                    club after Camp Nou and Westfalenstadion.Named after footballer and former Real 
                    Madrid president Santiago Bernabéu, the stadium is one of the world's most 
                    famous football venues. It has hosted the final of the European Cup/UEFA 
                    Champions League on four occasions: in 1957, 1969, 1980, 2010.[6] The stadium 
                    also hosted second leg of the 2018 Copa Libertadores Finals,making Santiago 
                    Bernabéu the first(and only)stadium to host the two most important premier 
                    continental cup finals (UEFA Champions League and Copa Libertadores).The final 
                    matches for the 1964 European Nations' Cup and the 1982 FIFA World Cup were 
                    also held at the Bernabéu, making it the first stadium in Europe to host 
                    both a UEFA Euro final and a FIFA World Cup final.

                    The Emirates Stadium replaced Arsenal’s previous home Highbury, which had become 
                    too small and lacked the possiblities for expansion being hemmed in by housing.
                    First plans for the of a new stadium were made in the late 1990s, but also a 
                    move to the new Wembley Stadium was considered.In the end a site was chosen 
                    just a few hundred yards away from Highbury,and after a few delays, 
                    construction of the stadium started in 2004. The total project budget amounted 
                    to £390 million.The Emirates Stadium officially opened on the 23rd of July 2006. 
                    The first match was a testimonial match for Dennis Bergkamp featuring an Arsenal 
                    and Ajax side.Due to the competition of nearby Wembley Stadium, the Emirates 
                    Stadium has never hosted the English national team, however the Brazilian 
                    national team has regularly staged friendlies at the stadium.

                    The Allianz Arena replaced Munich’s old Olympiastadion. First plans for a new 
                    stadium were made in 1997,and even though the city of Munich initially 
                    preferred reconstructing the Olympiastadion, they eventually went ahead with 
                    the clubs’proposal for an entire new stadium.Construction of the Allianz Arena 
                    started in October 2002, with a total investment in the project of €340 
                    million.The first match at the stadium, between TSV 1860 and 1. FC Nürnberg 
                    (3-2), was played on the 30th of May 2005. One day later Bayern played a 
                    friendly against the German national team (4-2).The Allianz Arena was one of 
                    the playing venues of the 2006 World Cup. During the tournament it hosted, 
                    among others, the opening match between Germany andCosta Rica (4-2) and the 
                    semi-final between France and Portugal (1-0).In 2012, the Allianz Arena was the 
                    host of the Champions League final between Chelsea and Bayern (1-1).In recent 
                    years, the arena was first expanded with an additional 3,000 seats and then by 
                    another 6,000 seats, mainly by creating extra space at the top of the upper tier 
                    and implementing optimisationsto the stands.
