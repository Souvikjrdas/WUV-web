            In the first decade of the 20th century, Manchester United played their home matches at a 50,000
            -stadium at Bank Street,when then president Davies began planning for a new stadium with double 
            that capacity. A site was chosen near Trafford Park industrial estate, and architect Archibald 
            Leitch was appointed to design the stadium.Old Trafford officially opened on 19 February 1910 
            with a match between Manchester and Liverpool (3-4). The stadium at that time consisted of one 
            covered seating stand and open terraces on the other three sides. Capacity was slightly over 
            80,000.Few changes were made to the stadium until the construction of a roof over the United 
            Road terrace in 1934.In 1939, Old Trafford recorded its highest attendance of 76,962 during 
            an FA Cup semi-final match between Wolves and Grimsby Town.

        Barça's new stadium replaced their old ground of Les Corts which with a capacity of just 48,000 
        was too small to accomodate the interest generated by a team led by Hungarian star Ladislao 
        Kubala.The stadium was designed by architects Francesc Mitjans Miró and Josep Soteras Mauri, 
        with the collaboration of Lorenzo García Barbón,and it was constructed between 1955 and 1957, 
        using mainly concrete and iron. The whole project cost a staggering 288 million pesetas, which 
        meant the club would spend the following years heavily in debt.Although it was originally going 
        to go under the official name of ‘Estadi del FC Barcelona’,it soon came to be popularly known as
         the 'Camp Nou' (the ‘new ground’), as opposed to the club’s old home at Les Corts. It was not 
         until the 2000/2001 season that,following a postal vote made by the Club membership,that the 
         decision was made to make ‘Camp Nou’ the official name of the stadium. Of the 29,102 votes the 
         club received, a total of 19,861 (68.25%) preferred Camp Nou.

        Stamford Bridge officially opened on the 28th of April 1877, but for the next 28 years mainly 
        served as an athletics venue.The owners, however, wanted a stadium that could host professional 
        football, and hired architect Archibald Leitch to design a new stadium.Stamford Bridge got almost 
        completely rebuilt in 1905,and was subsequently offered to Fulham FC. Fulham turned the offer down 
        though, and newly formed Chelsea FC moved in instead.Stamford Bridge at that time consisted of one 
        covered seating stand and a vast open bowl of terraces covering the other three sides. An estimated 
        100,000 people could fit into the stadium.Few changes were made until 1930, when new terraces were 
        built at the Shed End, and, nine years later, when a small seating stand was built at the North End.
        Stamford Bridge recorded its highest attendance in 1935 during a match against Arsenal when a total 
        of 82,905 fans attended the match.

        The Santiago Bernabéu Stadium (Spanish: Estadio Santiago Bernabéu, [esˈtaðjo sanˈtjaɣo βeɾnaˈβew] 
        (About this soundlisten)) is a football stadium in Madrid, Spain.With a current seating capacity of 
        81,044,[5] it has been the home stadium of Real Madrid since its completion in 1947.[2] It is the 
        second-largest stadium in Spain and third-largest home to a top-flight European club after Camp Nou 
        and Westfalenstadion.Named after footballer and former Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabéu, the 
        stadium is one of the world's most famous football venues. It has hosted the final of the European 
        Cup/UEFA Champions League on four occasions: in 1957, 1969, 1980, 2010.[6] The stadium also hosted the 
        second leg of the 2018 Copa Libertadores Finals,making Santiago Bernabéu the first (and only) stadium 
        to host the two most important premier continental cup finals (UEFA Champions League and Copa 
        Libertadores).The final matches for the 1964 European Nations' Cup and the 1982 FIFA World Cup 
        were also held at the Bernabéu, making it the first stadium in Europe to host both a UEFA Euro final 
        and a FIFA World Cup final.

        The Emirates Stadium replaced Arsenal’s previous home Highbury, which had become too small and lacked 
        the possiblities for expansion being hemmed in by housing.First plans for the construction of a new 
        stadium were made in the late 1990s, but also a move to the new Wembley 
        Stadium was considered.In the end a site was chosen just a few hundred yards away from Highbury, and,
        after a few delays, construction of 
        the stadium started in 2004. The total project budget amounted to £390 million.
        The Emirates Stadium officially opened on the 23rd of July 2006. The first match was a testimonial 
        match for Dennis Bergkamp featuring an 
        Arsenal and Ajax side.Due to the competition of nearby Wembley Stadium, the Emirates Stadium has 
        never hosted the English national team, 
        however the Brazilian national team has regularly staged friendlies at the stadium.

    The Allianz Arena replaced Munich’s old Olympiastadion. First plans for a new stadium were made in 1997, 
    and even though the city of Munich 
    initially preferred reconstructing the Olympiastadion, they eventually went ahead with the clubs’proposal 
    for an entire new stadium.Construction of the Allianz Arena started in October 2002, with a total 
    investment in the project of €340 million.The first match at the stadium, between TSV 1860 and 1. 
    FC Nürnberg (3-2), was played on the 30th of May 2005. One day later Bayern played a friendly 
    against the German national team (4-2).The Allianz Arena was one of the playing venues of the 
    2006 World Cup. During the tournament it hosted, among others, the opening match between Germany andCosta 
    Rica (4-2) and the semi-final between France and Portugal (1-0).In 2012, the Allianz Arena was the host 
    of the Champions League final between Chelsea and Bayern (1-1).In recent years, the arena was first 
    expanded with an additional 3,000 seats and then by another 6,000 seats, mainly by creating extra space 
    at the top of the upper tier and implementing optimisationsto the stands.While the Allianz Arena soon 
    turned out to be too small for Bayern, TSV found it more difficult to fill the arena, and struggled with 
    the high rental costs.In 2006, they sold their stake in the arena to Bayern and went on to agree a lease 
    contract. However, they never felt completely at home and in 2017 decided to move back to Grunwalder 
    Stadion, which had been their home until 1995.The Allianz Arena will be one of the playing venues of the 
    Euro 2020 tournament, hosting three group matches and one quarter-final, 
    and is also one of the playing venues of the Euro 2024 tournament.
